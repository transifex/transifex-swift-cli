Transifex Command Line Tool uses [Transifex iOS SDK](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-swift/)
to assist developers in pushing and pulling localizations of an iOS application (written in
Swift or Objective-C) to and from Transifex CDS.

For pushing the base localization of the application, the tool uses the `xcodebuild`
command to export the base localization to a temporary folder, then parses the generated
`.xliff` file that contains all the localizable strings of the app and transforms them in the
format that CDS accepts (`TXSourceString`). After getting all the translated strings in the
proper format, it pushes them to CDS. For more information, look into the
[Pushing](#pushing) section of this README.

For pulling the translated localizations, the developer must specify the locale codes and an
output folder, and the command line tool will download them, serialize them in a file
(`txstrings.json`) and store them in the specified folder. For more information, look into
the [Pulling](#pulling) section of this README.

Developer can also use the `invalidate` command to force CDS cache invalidation so
that the next `pull` command will fetch fresh translations from the CDS.

The token and secret strings can be provided by the developer either as arguments in the
command line tool or as enviroment variables (`TRANSIFEX_TOKEN`, `TRANSIFEX_SECRET`).

### Installation

You can either use the tool by typing: `swift run txios-cli` in the root directory of
the project, or you can install the executable to `/usr/local/bin` directory so that you can
call it from any folder.

In order to copy the executable, you can first build the project with
`swift build -c release` and then copy it with
`cp .build/release/txios-cli /usr/local/bin/txios-cli`.

### Usage

The following calls can be either made from within the `TXCli` project directory by:
`swift run txios-cli <cli command>`
or after following the installation instructions above,  from any folder of your computer by:
`txios-cli <cli command>`.

Bear in mind that due to naming collision, the `--verbose` flag won't be detected if the
`txios-cli` is executed via the `swift run` command, as the flag will be applied on the
`swift` executable instead. So to avoid collisions like this, it's recommended to execute
`txios-cli` directly after building it.

For simplicity the following examples will use the latter command.

#### Help

`txios-cli`, `txios-cli -h`, `txios-cli --help`

Displays helpful information for the CLI tool and lists all the subcommands.

`txios-cli [subcommand] --help`

or

`txios-cli help [subcommand]`

Displays helpful information for a subcommand and lists all of its options.

#### Pushing

`txios-cli push --token <transifex_token> --secret <transifex_secret> --project MyApp.xcodeproj`

Exports the base localization of the provided Xcode project, parses the generated XLIFF
file, transforms the translation units to the format Transifex accepts and pushes them to
the Transifex server.

If the developer has already set the enviroment variables mentioned above, then this
command can be simplified to:

`txios-cli push --project MyApp.xcodeproj`

##### Excluding files

With the `--excluded-files` option in the `push` command, an optional list of filenames can be excluded from processing.

Developers can offer a space separated list of filenames that must be filtered out by the CLI before the strings are pushed to CDS.

Example:

```
txios-cli push ... --excluded-files ExcludedFile1.strings ExcludedFile2.strings
```

> Note: If a string is included both in the excluded filenames and is also found in non-excluded filenames, it will be included in the push data.

##### Hashing keys on push

By default, the `txios-cli` tool will hash the key of each source string that
is about to be pushed to CDS.

If the developer prefers to maintain the original keys as they already exist in
the application, they can provide the `--disable-hash-keys` option.

The keys are always printed to the console when the `--verbose` option is active.

Example:

`txios-cli push --project MyApp.xcodeproj --verbose`

```
Pushing translations to CDS: [
"hashkey1": "string1"
,
"hashkey2": "string2"
]...
```

`txios-cli push --project MyApp.xcodeproj --verbose --disable-hash-keys`

```
Pushing translations to CDS: [
"string key 1": "string1"
,
"string key 2": "string2"
]...
```

##### Specifying a base SDK

The `txios-cli` tool calls the `xcodebuild` process to export the localizations
using the `-exportLocalizations` option. When that happens, the system automatically
picks the base SDK to be used (`iphoneos`, `macosx` etc).

There have been cases where the base SDK is not picked up correctly by the `xcodebuild`
process and a specific base SDK needs to be provided externally.

If the `push` command fails with errors like "no such module 'UIKit'", the developer
can manually specify the base SDK to be used using the `--base-sdk` option of the `push`
command. For example, for iOS applications the option can be set to `--base-sdk iphoneos`.

##### Pushing pluralizations

Pluralization rules both on the new String Catalogs (`.xcstrings`) and the old Strings
Dictionary (`.stringsdict`) formats are generally supported.

Single, plural rules are converted to the ICU format when pushed to CDS while more
complex rules (device variations, substitutions, combinations) are converted to an
intermediate XML format when pushed to CDS and converted back to the proper format
when the SDK populates its cache during its initialization.

The only variation related limitation concerns the width variants [^1] [^2].

##### Further notes

* In order for the `push` command to be successful, the target project / workspace
must be buildable by Xcode with no compilation errors.

* If you are trying to `push` the translations of a CocoaPods project, then use
the `.xcworkspace` directory on the `--project` argument instead of the
`.xcodeproj` one, otherwise the `push` command will fail with framework not found
linker errors.

#### Pulling

`txios-cli pull --token <transifex_token> --translated-locales <translated_locale_list> --output <output_directory>`

Downloads the localizations from Transifex CDS for the specified translated locales, stores
them in a `txstrings.json` file to the output directory specified.

If the developer has already set the enviroment variables mentioned above, then this
command can be simplified to:

`txios-cli pull --translated-locales <translated_locale_list> --output <output_directory>`

#### Invalidating CDS cache

`txios-cli invalidate --token <transifex_token>`

Forces CDS cache invalidation so that the next `pull` command will fetch fresh translations
from CDS.

If the developer has already set the enviroment variable mentioned above, then this
command can be simplified to:

`txios-cli invalidate`
