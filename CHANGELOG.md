control whether the keys of strings to be pushed should be hashed or not.

## Transifex Command Line Tool 2.0.0

*July 7, 2023*

- `push` command now logs any warnings and errors generated during the
processing and push of the source strings.
- Source strings that only exist in files not supported by Transifex SDK are
now ommited.
- Extra options have been introduced for the `push` command:
`--override-tags`, `--override-occurrences`, `--keep-translations`.
- Push logic detects and reports warnings such as duplicate source string keys
or empty source string keys.
- The default value for the `hashKeys` option of the `push` command has been
flipped, so by default the tool **does not** hash the keys of the provided
source strings, respecting the original keys passed by the developer.

## Transifex Command Line Tool 2.1.0

*August 21, 2023*

- Extra option for the `push` command has been introduced: `--excluded-files`
that excludes the provided filenames from processing, filtering out any included
strings.

## Transifex Command Line Tool 2.1.1

*September 21, 2023*

- Adds `--source-locale` option to `pull` command so that developers can specify
the source locale, if it's different than `en`. If not provided, the `pull`
logic default to the `en` source locale.
- Fixes an issue on `push` command where the unsupported SDK files were not
being excluded by the localization parsing logic.
- Addresses language tag discrepancy: In the `push` command, the
`--source-locale` option refers to the source locale of the Xcode project and
the format used by Xcode and iOS is different than the format used by Transifex
(e.g `en-US` instead of `en_US`). For that reason the source locale string is
now normalized before being passed to the exporter logic so that the latter can
always be able to export the source locale from the Xcode project.

option, in order to allow the underlying `keep_translations` meta flag to be
set to `false`.
